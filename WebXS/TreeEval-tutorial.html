    <h1>Using TreeEval for REST APIs</h1>
    <p>TreeEval.js is a JavaScript API that defines tree evaluation in a given
    context. It comes with a pre-defined HTML context for trees, as well as a
    tree evaluator for string building. Using these, we can easily describe a
    flow-controlled string builder in HTML, and have TreeEval.js interpret it.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a REST API?</h2>
    <p>A REST API is an API defined by a website that allows access to it via
    well-formed url requests. For example, an online chemical database might
    have a regular search page that allows users to search for chemicals with
    their web browser. However, they might want to make it easier for people to
    access their content programmatically. Of course, one could just scrape the
    site, but writing a scraper is a tedious and fragile process, and scraping
    may put unnecessary strain on the web servers. As an alternative that
    benefits both parties, the website can define a REST API. This would allow
    users to query the database by submitting a request to a specially-formatted
    url and receive in return data from the database.</p>

    <h2>Why TreeEval?</h2>
    <p>REST APIs, such as
    <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pug_rest/PUG_REST.html">PUG
    REST</a>, can often be described in terms of symbolic and literal values.
    The symbols can in turn be defined by more symbolic and literal values,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">and so on</a>
    until the whole thing can be viewed as a well-defined way to format
    pre-defined string values. One can visualize this in terms of a tree.
    In fact, it can be seen as a tree in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Required Inputs:</b> Using PUG REST as an example, we can see that
      its requests must contain 4 elements: a literal url element, a symbolic
      input element, a symbolic operation element, and a symbolic output
      element Furthermore, an input specification contains 3 elements: a
      symbolic domain element, a symbolic namespace element, and a symbolic
      identifier element. Each of the other top-level symbolic elements have
      their own specifications as well. One can see that the format of a PUG
      REST request can be described as a tree of symbols.</li>
      <li><b>Possible Inputs:</b> Some elements are defined to take on one of
      many possible inputs. In PUG REST, a compound domain namespace element
      is defined to take on one of many values. One such possibility is an
      xref element. In turn, an xref element is made up of one specific literal
      element and one of many other literal elements. When considering all the
      possible inputs to the query, one can visualize a tree that holds all the
      possibilities.</li>
