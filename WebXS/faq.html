Jmol will not load, what do I do?<br><br>

On opening the page, a methane molecule should show up. If not, try <br><br>

-Installing the latest version of Java from Oracle. 6.x or higher.<br>
-Ensuring you have java enabled in your web browser.<br>
-Refreshing the page and clearing the browser cache.<br>

IcedTea v.XX-XXX crashed? <br><br>
This is a symptom of not having the proper java suite installed.  Please install the latest Sun Microsystems Java from Oracle.<br><br>

Why can't I upload coordinates?<br><br>

The uploading mechanism is only supported on recent versions google chrome and firefox.  Safari 6 may have support when it is relased, so may IE 10.  Make sure you browser is HTML5 enabled.<br><br><br><br>

What is that red line on the Spectrum?<br><br>

That line marks where valid data ends.  Anything computed past that edge may be garbage and is simply interpolated data.<br><br><br><br>

When I upload my file, there are extra bonds or missing bonds in the molecular viewer, why is that? <br><br>

The tool only requires the atomic coordinates, the bonding information is not necessary.  The 3D image is made from the positions of the atoms, an defaults to single bonds between atoms, connecting any atoms that are close enough together.  As long as the coordinates are right, this will not affect the output.<br><br><br><br>

Everything I run crashes, why won't it run?<br><br>

Please make sure you are not using too many processors, and that you have given enough walltime for your calculation to finish.  This may take some fine tuning.  If you have more trouble, try lowering the NBANDFAC variable to 2 or 4.<br><br>

Not all molecules have psuedopotentials calculated, please do not try to run excited plutoniums and the like, the tool will not be able to calculate them.<br><br>
