provided the conditions of the GPL (GNU Public License) are met.

Although you are not required to do so, the author would consider
it a courtesy if you submit to him any changes you consider to be
worthwhile. The goal would be to keep the development of GDIS more
or less centralized.

Some cool features of GDIS are entirely due to the hard work that
has gone into creating the following packages:

1. CDD for the computation of halfspace intersections (morphology display).
   (c) Komei Fukuda

2. GPeriodic for pretty Periodic Table display and editing.
   (c) 1999 Kyle R. Burton 

3. SgInfo for Space Group generator lookup.
   (c) 1994-96 Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve

4. Brute force symmetry analyzer.
   (c) 1996 S. Pachkovsky 

Notes
-----

There are a few optional packages that enhance the GDIS experience.

1. For rendering (and subsequent image viewing) you will need:
  - POVRay 
  - ImageMagick (or an image viewer similar to 'display')

2. For rendered animations, you will need:
  - ImageMagick
  - mpeg2encode (if you want to output MPEG's)

3. For molecule minimization, you will need:
  - GULP

4. To load certain filetypes, such as PDB, you will need:
  - Babel
