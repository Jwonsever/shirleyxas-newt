GDIS comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

This is free software. You are welcome to redistribute copies
provided the conditions of the GPL (GNU Public License) are met.

Although you are not required to do so, the author would consider
it a courtesy if you submit to him any changes you consider to be
worthwhile. The goal would be to keep the development of GDIS more
or less centralized.


Compile Notes
=============

The "install" script that came with the source distribution of GDIS
can be executed to assist with the compile process.

Hit the <enter> key for default settings at each query, for example
hitting <enter> when the script prompts you for the install directory
will compile GDIS to the current working directory.

The script uses pkg-config to locate and configure your local compile.
It should also report if there are required libraries you need to
install before a GDIS executable can be created.


Optional
========

There are a few optional packages that enhance the GDIS experience.

1. For ray tracing (and subsequent image viewing) you will need:
  - POVRay 
  - ImageMagick (or an image viewer similar to 'display')

2. For rendered animations, you will need:
  - ImageMagick
  - mpeg2encode (if you want to output MPEG's)

3. For energy calculations you may need to be able to execute:
  - GULP
  - GAMESS
