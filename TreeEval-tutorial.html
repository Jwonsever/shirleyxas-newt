    <h1>Using TreeEval for REST APIs</h1>
    <p>TreeEval.js is a JavaScript API that defines tree evaluation in a given
    context. It comes with a pre-defined HTML context for trees, as well as a
    tree evaluator for string building. Using these, we can easily describe a
    flow-controlled string builder in HTML, and have TreeEval.js interpret it.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a REST API?</h2>
    <p>A REST API is an API defined by a website that allows access to it via
    well-formed url requests. For example, an online chemical database might
    have a regular search page that allows users to search for chemicals with
    their web browser. However, they might want to make it easier for people to
    access their content programmatically. Of course, one could just scrape the
    site, but writing a scraper is a tedious and fragile process, and scraping
    may put unnecessary strain on the web servers. As an alternative that
    benefits both parties, the website can define a REST API. This would allow
    users to query the database by submitting a request to a specially-formatted
    url and receive in return data from the database.</p>

    <h2>Why TreeEval?</h2>
    <p>REST APIs, such as
    <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pug_rest/PUG_REST.html">PUG
    REST</a>, can often be described in terms of symbolic and literal values.
    The symbols can in turn be defined by more symbolic and literal values,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">and so on</a>
    until the whole thing can be viewed as a well-defined way to format
    pre-defined string values. One can visualize this in terms of a tree.
    In fact, it can be seen as a tree in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Required Inputs:</b> Using PUG REST as an example, we can see that
      its requests must contain 4 elements: a literal url element, a symbolic
      <i>input</i> element, a symbolic <i>operation</i> element, and a symbolic
      <i>output</i> element Furthermore, an <i>input</i> specification contains
      3 elements: a symbolic <i>domain</i> element, a symbolic <i>namespace</i>
      element, and a symbolic <i>identifier</i> element. Each of the other
      top-level symbolic elements have their own specifications as well. One can
      see that the format of a PUG REST request can be described as a tree of
      symbols.</li>
      <li><b>Possible Inputs:</b> Some elements are defined to take on one of
      many possible inputs. In PUG REST, a compound domain <i>namespace</i>
      element is defined to take on one of many values. One such possibility is
      an <i>xref</i> element. In turn, an <i>xref</i> element is made up of one
      specific literal element and one of many other literal elements. When
      considering all the possible inputs to the query, one can visualize a tree
      that holds all the possibilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, one can construct queries for REST APIs by using a string builder
    that can handle these two types of trees. Enter TreeEval.js.</p>

    <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
    <p>Indeed, TreeEval.js supports both of the proper tree abstractions for
    proper string building. Here's how.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Lists:</b> Symbolic elements are elements made up
      of multiple other elements, each of which is either symbolic or literal.
      In TreeEval.js, this group of sub-elements is called a <i>list</i>. A
      list is simply a sequence of elements that should be combined in some
      way. Lists are typically named for how the sub-elements are combined.
      For example, PUG REST defines that the three sub-elements (<i>domain</i>,
      <i>namespace</i>, and <i>identifiers</i>) of an <i>input</i> element
      should be combined with slashes (/) between each one. This type of list
      is called a <i>slash list</i>.
      <li><b>Recursion:</b> In order to evaluate a PUG REST string, we must
      first evaluate a literal <i>url</i> sum-element, and symbolic
      sub-elements <i>input</i>, <i>operation</i>, <i>output</i>, and perhaps
      <i>operation options</i>. In order to evaluate an <i>input</i> element,
      one must first evaluate the sub-elements <i>domain</i>, <i>namespace</i>,
      and <i>identifiers</i>. One can see that the evaluation process is
      recursive, as expected from a tree structure. TreeEval.js is built from
      the bottom-up for recursion, and is in essence an engine for recursive
      tree evaluation.</li>
      <li><b>Forks:</b> Fork elements define a choice between one of several
      elements. When an element can take on one of several values, such as
      PUG REST's compound domain <i>namespace</i> element, a fork is used to
      define the different possibilities. These could each be nodes of
      different types. Whichever possibility is chosen, TreeEval.js will
      evaluate it as the appropriate type. For example, if the above element
      took on the literal element with value "cid", then recursion would stop
      there. However, if the symbolic node <i>xref</i> was chosen, further
      recursive evaluation would be required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The TreeEval.js API for tree recursion contains two main parts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Context:</b> A TreeEval.js Context answers the question
      <i>what is a tree?</i> Its purpose is to provide an interface that makes
      something look like a tree. TreeEval.js comes with a pre-defined Context
      that allows to describe such a tree in HTML. Such tree properties include:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Node Type:</b> Each node should be of a certain type. So far,
        only <i>literals</i> and <i>symbols</i> have been discussed. Actually,
        TreeEval.js distinguishes between different kinds of symbolic nodes.
        Here is a list of the types of nodes currently supported:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Literals:</b> Literal nodes are nodes that do not require
          recursion to evaluate; they hold a string value. An example is the
          <i>url</i> element of a PUG REST request: the leading part of the
          request always contains PubChem's url. In HTML, literal nodes can be
          created using &lt;input&gt; elements, see the code for which type
          attributes define literals. Also, &lt;select&gt; elements can be
          treated as literals if, with their current selection, they do not
          progress to another node (see <i>Forks</i> sections).</li>
          <li><b>Lists:</b> A list node is a symbolic node that is defined as
          a collection of <i>sub-nodes</i> that are to be combined in some way
          (see the previous <i>Lists</i> section). In HTML, lists are made
          using &lt;div&gt; elements, and their contents determine the
          sub-elements of the list. The type of the list is defined using one of
          TreeEval.js's HTML5 data-* attributes. The general format for these is
          <i>data-te-list-&lt;type&gt;="True"</i>. For example, to define a
          <i>slash list</i>, the attribute is <i>data-te-list-slash="True"</i>.
          </li>
          <li><b>Forks:</b> A fork node is a symbolic node whose value can take
          the value of one of several other nodes (see the previous
          <i>Forks</i> section). In HTML, forks are made using &lt;select&gt;
          elements. The selected item from the drop-down determines how the
          node is evaluated. The <i>value</i> property of the DOM node is used
          to try to find a next node to evaluate (see the
          <i>Node Progression</i> section). If it can find a node to progress
          to, it will evaluate it, thus treating the selection as a symbolic
          node. If it cannot find a node to progress to, it will treat it as
          a literal node, and the value of the selected option is used as its
          value. This can be used as a sort of shortcut for making literal
          nodes one of the options of a fork, instead of having the fork
          progress to an &lt;input&gt; element.</li>
          <li><b>Pointers:</b> Pointers are simply symbolic elements that
          forward to other elements (see the <i>Node Progression</i> section).
          These can be used mainly for convenience sake. They allow for reuse
          of elements if many elements all point to one. In HTML, these are
          implemented with &lt;div&gt; elements that forward themselves to other
          elements. This can be done by adding an HTML5 data-* attiribute of the
          form <i>data-te-forward-to="&lt;target_id&gt;"</i>. In the context of
          HTML, pointers can be used put an element in one place (maybe for
          the sake of user interface) but evaluate it from somewhere else.
          Perhaps the pointer is a member of a list, but the pointer's target
          is not.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Node Progression:</b> In order to evaluate a tree, one must be
        able to traverse it. In order to traverse it, one must know how to get
        from one node to another, and when to stop. When evaluating a literal
        node this is easy to decide: recursion stops. Otherwise, a Context must
        define how to progress through the tree's nodes. This happens in two
        steps:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Forwarding:</b> TreeEval.js's HTML Context uses the <i>id</i>
          attribute to model the tree structure. It uses snake_case with each
          underscore-separated word representing a node, and a node being the
          direct descentant of the node to its left. For example, the id
          <i>"grandparent_parent_child"</i>, should be put on the node named
          <i>child</i> whose parent is named <i>parent</i>, whose parent is
          in turn named <i>grandparent</i>. Forwarding is the process of
          changing the id as the tree is traversed, and it can be customized
          with three different data-* attributes. Forwarding happens before
          forking, so if the current node is a fork, these happen before the
          value is tacked onto the end. <i>Note:</i> the forwarding steps
          are processed in this order, which is important if a node customizes
          more than one of them.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Forward Through:</b> Usage:
            <i>data-te-forward-through="True"</i>. This will chop off the last
            underscore-section of the id before advancing to the next node.
            </li>
            <li><b>Forward With:</b> Usage:
            <i>data-te-forward-with="&lt;tack_value&gt;"</i>. This will tack an
            underscore-section onto the end of the id before advancing to the
            next node.</li>
            <li><b>Forward To:</b> Usage:
            <i>data-te-forward-to="&lt;id&gt;"</i>. This will completely
            replace the working id with the given one. This is used to create
            pointer nodes (see the <i>Pointers</i> section).</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Forking:</b> When progressing through a fork node, one must
          know whether or not it forks to a symbolic or a literal node. This is
          determined by creating a unique id from each of its options, and then
          looking for an element with that id. To create such an id, the value
          of the selected option is tacked onto the end of the id of the fork
          in question, with an underscore in front separating it.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><b>Evaluator:</b> While Contexts provide the tree, Evaluators
      work with it. They are in charge of traversing the tree and evaluating
      it in a certain way. The provided Evaluator implements string-building.
      When using TreeEval.js to use REST APIs, you can treat this mostly as a
      black box. Although, you may want to take a look at the types of lists
      it supports.</li>
    </ul>
